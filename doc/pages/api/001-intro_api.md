# Introduction

<img align="right" src="assets/mascot_developer.svg" style="border:20px solid transparent" alt="Join Puppy Lion and have some fun with Astarte!" width="40%" />

Astarte's APIs are documented through [Swagger](https://swagger.io/). Your Astarte installation probably already has Swagger UI support, which serves as the reference for your installed APIs. API documentation provided here is generated thanks to the amazing [swagger2markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup/swagger2markup) automatically from the reference branch/release.
